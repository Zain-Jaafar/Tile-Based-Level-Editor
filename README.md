# Tile-Based-Level-Editor
This is a Tile Based Level Editor I'm working on.

### Controls
Press H to show/hide the side panel <br>
Move around using the arrow keys <br>
Left-click on an image in the side panel to select it <br>
Left-click on the grid to add a tile <br>
Right-click on the grid to remove a tile <br>

### IMPORTANT
You need a Images/Tiles/ folder in the codes' directory. <br>
Any folder directly in the Tiles folder will be used as a tile group, and any tiles inside those folders will be used as a selectable tile.
