# Tile-Based-Level-Editor
This is a Tile Based Level Editor I'm working on.

### Controls
Press H to show/hide the side panel
Move around using the arrow keys
Left-click on an image in the side panel to select it
Left-click on the grid to add a tile
Right-click on the grid to remove a tile

### IMPORTANT
You need a Images/Tiles/ folder in the codes' directory.
Any folder directly in the Tiles folder will be used as a tile group, and any tiles inside those folders will be used as a selectable tile.
